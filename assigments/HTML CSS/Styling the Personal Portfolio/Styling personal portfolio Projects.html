                    A "Semantic HTML Project" is an initiative that focuses on using HTML elements to create web content
                    with clear, meaningful structure. It ensures that web pages are accessible and well-organized for
                    both humans and search engines. By employing semantic HTML elements like headings, lists, tables,

                    (SEO) of a website. It's an essential practice for creating web content that is not only visually
                    appealing but also easy to understand and navigate.</p>
