    <!-- Write a program that constantly asks the user to write positive numbers and adds them together.
         If the user enters 0 that signifies that they are finished writing numbers and would like to know the sum. 
         For example, the user could write 1 then 5 then 9 then 0. In the console you would say:
          The sum of the numbers you wrote is equal to 15. -->
